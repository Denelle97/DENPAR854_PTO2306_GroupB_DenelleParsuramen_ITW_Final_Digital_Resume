## Project Description:

In this final ITW Capstone Project, I'll create a dynamic Digital Resum√© Portfolio showcasing my mastery of HTML, CSS, and responsive design. The portfolio will encompass my professional journey, skills, and achievements, offering a user-friendly experience.

The project includes a captivating Header introducing my identity and career goals, with direct links to the Contact section and my GitHub account. An Education section will outline my academic achievements, while the Skills section will highlight my technical expertise.

The portfolio's responsive design will ensure seamless browsing across devices. Using Flexbox and CSS Grid, I'll optimize content layout and visual appeal. The Contact section will feature external links and a FormSubmit-powered contact form, enhancing user interaction.

With a focus on code quality and user experience, this project represents the culmination of my learning journey in ITW. Through a live demonstration, I'll showcase my proficiency and decision-making in web development, reflecting growth and competence.
